With new measuring instrument, which can be successfully used by our monitoring specialists, as a reliable tool for eavesdropping protection and eavesdropping in Switzerland to detect various digital transmissions such as GSM, GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, etc. New methods of “listening and watching” with the help of modern technologies are widespread in our time. For example, a tiny GSM transmitter is accessible in virtually any internet spy shop for just 100-200 francs, and it can easily eavesdrop all your conversations in the office or at home. Perhaps even more important is the Bluetooth protocol, it has been specially developed for the transmission of voices or conversations with high quality at a distance of up to 100m, it can be easily used for eavesdropping. The sensitivity of a common RF detector (bug detector) is distributed over a wide frequency range, usually 3 or even 6-7 GHz. This means that the common detectors cannot detect such weak and non-continuous signals as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or Wi-Max. Even more powerful signals such as GSM-1800 are also difficult to detect due to their low sensitivity at higher frequency ranges. The only way to reliably detect wireless protocols is to use pre-selector chips (saw filters) that attenuate all but the desired signals. This is the method implemented in FocusControl, which can search 6 channels for different frequency ranges and at the same time detect 6 different types of transmissions at a distance much larger than all common RF detectors. Such characteristics make it a highly desirable and reliable interception protection during surveillance. It is recommended that all sources of RF waves in the premises be detected during a search. It is necessary to determine the type of each source – whether it is a regular station such as a Wi-Fi access point or whether it has an unclear origin and should therefore be checked and probably removed.

The bank is currently managed by the sixth generation of the founding family and employs around 200 people, most of whom have been with the bank for many years. Bank Dreyfus is headquartered in Basel. It also has offices in Delémont, Lausanne, Lugano, Zurich and Tel Aviv. With an equity ratio that is several times higher than the legal requirements, Dreyfus Banquiers ensures its autonomy and independence. In addition, this allows it to forego short-term profit maximisation. In order to maintain its independence, the bank deliberately refrains from investment banking. Dreyfus Banquiers focuses on managing the assets of private and institutional clients. At the same time, the bank has a wealth of experience with family organisations, trusts and foundations. The bank manages the assets entrusted to it according to the principles of long-term asset preservation and risk-controlled asset growth. All of the bank's services are tailored to the individual needs of each client. The focus of client relationships is on privacy, continuity and individual solutions. Even in the case of management mandates, where our clients grant the bank extensive powers of attorney, the permanent dialogue with the client enables the realisation of individual wishes and investment goals. It is not unusual for the relationship between bank and client to last several generations. Among the employees, the bank attaches great importance to a long-term working relationship. This means, among other things, that the same advisors are always available to their clients and thus a solid basis of trust can be built up. Asset management Individually tailored asset management mandates are one of our core competencies. Based on a personal discussion and the joint definition of a risk profile, we create the starting point for the targeted investment of your assets primarily in direct investments. Collective investment products can also be used to cover special investment needs. Investment advice Our long-standing and experienced relationship managers are at your side as partners for your personal investment decisions. You benefit from access to the most modern and comprehensive information systems. We will be happy to prepare investment proposals according to your wishes. Our core service also includes a consolidated view of assets. This allows a detailed risk analysis, which may result in concrete measures. Basic services Securities trading, safekeeping of securities, collection of dividends and interest, corporate actions, regular and clear asset and account statements, account management in various currencies, domestic and foreign payment transactions, cheque collection and issuing, direct debiting, deposits and withdrawals in Swiss francs and foreign currencies, credit and Maestro cards, tax documents, withholding tax reclaims, information banking. Family Office Our tailor-made services enable us to provide overall support and advice for individuals, families, family businesses, communities of heirs and companies. If external support is required, you benefit from a select network of specialists. In order to maintain our independence, we deliberately refrain from investment banking. Cooperation with external asset managers Our experienced specialists for the support of external asset managers are happy to assist you personally and individually in daily contact. Services for foundations & associations Are you primarily interested in fulfilling the activities and purpose of your foundation? Thanks to the professional advice of our experts, you have more time to do so. You can confidently leave the selection of investments to us according to the needs of your foundation. As a traditional family business, we have been aware for generations of how important it is to assume social responsibility. That is why the owner families and the bank have always been committed to philanthropy and also established the Isaac Dreyfus-Bernheim Foundation to mark the 200th anniversary in 2013. Thanks to these many years of experience, we are very familiar with the management and administration of charitable foundations. You too can benefit from our wealth of experience.

With new measuring instrument, which can be successfully used by our monitoring specialists, as a reliable tool for eavesdropping protection and eavesdropping in Switzerland to detect various digital transmissions such as GSM, GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, etc. New methods of “listening and watching” with the help of modern technologies are widespread in our time. For example, a tiny GSM transmitter is accessible in virtually any internet spy shop for just 100-200 francs, and it can easily eavesdrop all your conversations in the office or at home. Perhaps even more important is the Bluetooth protocol, it has been specially developed for the transmission of voices or conversations with high quality at a distance of up to 100m, it can be easily used for eavesdropping. The sensitivity of a common RF detector (bug detector) is distributed over a wide frequency range, usually 3 or even 6-7 GHz. This means that the common detectors cannot detect such weak and non-continuous signals as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or Wi-Max. Even more powerful signals such as GSM-1800 are also difficult to detect due to their low sensitivity at higher frequency ranges. The only way to reliably detect wireless protocols is to use pre-selector chips (saw filters) that attenuate all but the desired signals. This is the method implemented in FocusControl, which can search 6 channels for different frequency ranges and at the same time detect 6 different types of transmissions at a distance much larger than all common RF detectors. Such characteristics make it a highly desirable and reliable interception protection during surveillance. It is recommended that all sources of RF waves in the premises be detected during a search. It is necessary to determine the type of each source – whether it is a regular station such as a Wi-Fi access point or whether it has an unclear origin and should therefore be checked and probably removed.

This means, among other things, that the same advisors are always available to their clients and thus a solid basis of trust can be built up.
